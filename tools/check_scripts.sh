# Parse- and type-checks GDScript files.
#
# `godot --check-only -s <file>` runs the full GDScript analyser — it catches
# type mismatches and unknown identifiers, not just syntax — but always exits 0,
# so this wrapper scans its output for diagnostics and sets the status itself.
#
# Usage:  tools/check_scripts.sh [file.gd ...]
#
# With no arguments it checks every project script (the `check` target in the
# Makefile); with arguments, just those files — project-relative paths — which
# is what the post-edit hook (tools/check_gd_hook.sh) uses.
#
# Much faster than `make test` for "does what I just wrote compile?": it skips
# booting the scene tree and GUT.
